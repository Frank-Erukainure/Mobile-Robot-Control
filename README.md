# Mobile-Robot-Control
In this project, we demonstrate the control of a mobile robot (with servo motors) using PID controller with Ultrasonic sensor, as well as using a camera sensor with the Open CV library in Python. A video file has been attached to demonstrate the first test run of a red color-controlled mobile robot based on the Open CV library.
